## Sparky Watts

#### Profile

Sparky Watts is a first-year PhD student in an interdisciplinary energy studies department.
As she's preparing for her qualifying exams, Sparky is looking at the available energy
data sources that she could use for her doctoral research.

A few years ago, a postdoctoral scholar in her research lab worked on an analysis of hourly
demand data published by the EIA. With a clear research question in mind, Sparky is
interested in building on the postdoc's data cleaning scripts and updating them to
include newer years of data, but the code is scattered over several Jupyter Notebooks
without much documentation. None of the other lab members remember much about the
project.

Though Sparky has taken a Python Software Carpentry workshop before and done some coding
using Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks, she's not quite sure where to start. The data is
larger than other datasets she's worked with before, and she can't even open it in a
spreadsheet to look at a few rows without Excel crashing. Inspired by her experiences
of looking at this postdoc's code, she's hoping to write software that others will be
able to use and adapt for their own work long after she's left the lab.

#### Background knowledge and skills:

    Has energy domain knowledge and a research area in mind
    Recently attended the Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists workshop
    Can install software using GUI’s
    Has recently used Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to analyze tabular data

#### Goals:

    Adapt existing cleaning scripts to run more reproducibly on an open-source dataset
    Analyze data that's too big to work with in a spreadsheet
    Write and document code in a way that others can build on in the future

## Gene Rator

#### Profile

Gene Rator is a postdoctoral researcher studying the carbon intensity of electricity
production.

He writes his own analysis pipelines using Python scripts that he’s developed over the
years and is comfortable transforming data using Pandas.

Recently, Gene sent his scripts to a collaborator at another research institute, who
struggled to run the pipeline because it’s heavily tied to Gene's own research
environment.

Gene needs to publish his own pipeline to both share his work and fulfill publication
requirements. More worryingly, he recently tried re-running the pipeline after making
some small tweaks in response to feedback from a collaborator, and got some unexpected
results - something might be going wrong somewhere in his pipeline, but it's hard to
tell where.

Gene needs strategies to debug his existing workflow, and a way to effectively share his
work with collaborators and the public.

#### Background knowledge and skills:

    Proficient in writing Python scripts using Pandas
    Uses Git to manage his code locally
    Can install software using conda and write his own environment files

#### Goals:

    Debug unexpected problems in existing pipeline
    Specify his pipeline’s software requirements so that others can run it
    Publish his pipeline on his Github repository for broader research use
