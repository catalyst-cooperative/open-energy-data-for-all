After following this two-day lesson, learners will be able to:
* identify key open energy data sources suitable to answering energy research questions
* read in tabular data from XML, JSON, and Parquet formats using `pandas`
* request data stored in cloud buckets
* request data from a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
* scrape data from webpages using `beautifulsoup`
* visualize data to quickly understand patterns and anomalies
* write Python classes and functions to break down complex cleaning tasks into reusable and discrete steps
* write automated tests to ensure that their code works as expected
* troubleshoot performance issues, and handle data that is too large to fit in memory
* automatically detect unexpected values in inputs and outputs by writing data validation tests
* transform a local codebase into a collaborative project using Github repositories, code documentation, and virtual environments.
