:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

* what do I need to think about so that my project doesn't fall apart halfway to the finish line?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

* describe the phases of a data processing project

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Narrative

* you're trying to pick up this project from someone else
* goals: transparency & reproducibility for others
* here are the phases of an open research process: finding data, working with the data, sharing code & data with other people (as you're working on it!)

**TODO figure out if we want to have all these discussions as separate discussions, or one set of breakout groups***

### Finding data

You want to find data that has relevant information + has a good license so you can republish + others can reproduce

We won't teach you how to do this.

But. Look at public sources like EIA/FERC/EPA, PUCs, pudl

discussion/icebreaker:
* what data is interesting to you for your own work?

### Working with the data

Visualization
Analysis - this is your problem, not ours
Reusability - how to keep this ball of wax together
(chapters 2 and 3)

discussion:

* think about a time you had to re-run your old code. what were challenges you faced?

### Collaborating

You want your work to matter, right? Also sometimes you need to do this pro forma

GH, python environments, data environments/versioning, documentation

discussion:

* what was hard about working with someone else's code in the past?
