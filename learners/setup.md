## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Obtain lesson materials

TODO: Do we want people to fork the entire repo or just download the data? If the first, that should come after GH setup.
<!-- 1. Download [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip][zipfile1]
  and [python-novice-inflammation-code.zip][zipfile2].
2. Create a folder called `swc-python` on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded files to `swc-python`.
4. Unzip the files.

You should see two folders called `data` and `code` in the `swc-python` directory on your
Desktop. -->

## Accessing lesson data

### Create an API key for accessing the EIA API
In episode 3 and 4, we'll be learning how to access the Application Programming Interface (API)
for the Energy Information Administration (EIA). To register for an EIA API key:

1. Go to the [EIA API website](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/).
2. Click "Register" on the right-hand side and complete the form.
3. Log in to the email address you provided - you should have received an email from the
EIA with the subject line "EIA API Registration Key" that contains your API key.

### Create an API key for accessing the EPA API
In episode 3 and 4, we'll also be exploring the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
Clean Air Markets API portal. To register for an EPA API key:

1. Go to the [registration page](https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/cam-api-portal#/api-key-signup) and fill out the form.
2. Log in to the email address you provided. You should have received an email from the EPA
containing an API key for the Clean Air Markets API portal.

## Installing Git

Since many Carpentries lessons rely on Git, please see
[this section of the workshop template](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git) for
instructions on installing Git for various operating systems.

- [Git installation on Windows](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git)
- [Git installation on MacOS](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git)
- [Git installation on Linux](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git)

## Create an account on GitHub

You will need an account for [GitHub](https://github.com) to follow episodes *(TODO!)* in this lesson.

1. Go to <https://github.com> and follow the "Sign up" link at the top-right of the window.
2. Follow the instructions to create an account.
3. Verify your email address with GitHub.
4. Configure multifactor authentication (see below).

Basic GitHub accounts are free. As you set up your account,p lease consider what personal
information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review these
[instructions for keeping your email address private]("https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/") provided at GitHub.

### Multi-factor Authentication

In 2023, GitHub introduced a requirement for 
all accounts to have 
[multi-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication) 
configured for extra security.
Several options exist for setting up 2FA, which are summarised here:

1. If you already use an authenticator app, 
   like [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=0) 
   or [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) on your smartphone for example, 
   [add GitHub to that app](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app).
2. If you have access to a smartphone but do not already use an authenticator app, install one and 
   [add GitHub to the app](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app).
3. If you do not have access to a smartphone or do not want to install an authenticator app, you have two options:
    1. [set up 2FA via text message](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-text-messages) 
       ([list of countries where authentication by SMS is supported](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/countries-where-sms-authentication-is-supported)), or
    2. [use a hardware security key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-security-key) 
       like [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) 
       or the [Google Titan key](https://store.google.com/us/product/titan_security_key?hl=en-US&pli=1).

The GitHub documentation provides [more details about configuring 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

## Launch Python interface - TODO!

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.

## Option A: Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for working with Python.
If you installed Anaconda, you can launch a notebook in two ways:

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Anaconda Navigator

1. Launch Anaconda Navigator.
  It might ask you if you'd like to send anonymized usage information to Anaconda developers:
  ![](fig/anaconda-navigator-first-launch.png){alt='Anaconda Navigator first launch'}
  Make your choice and click "Ok, and don't show again" button.
2. Find the "Notebook" tab and click on the "Launch" button:
  ![](fig/anaconda-navigator-notebook-launch.png){alt='Anaconda Navigator Notebook launch'}
  Anaconda will open a new browser window or tab with a Notebook Dashboard showing you the
  contents of your Home (or User) folder.
3. Navigate to the `data` directory by clicking on the directory names leading to it:
  `Desktop`, `swc-python`, then `data`:
  ![](fig/jupyter-notebook-data-directory.png){alt='Anaconda Navigator Notebook directory'}
4. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button and then selecting "Python 3":

## Command line (Terminal)

1\. Navigate to the `data` directory:

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Unix shell

If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
in Linux, or [Git Bash][gitbash] on Windows, execute the following command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/swc-python/data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Command Prompt (Windows)

On Windows, you can use its native Command Prompt program.  The easiest way to start it up is
pressing <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd>\+<kbd>R</kbd>, entering `cmd`, and hitting
<kbd>Return</kbd>. In the Command Prompt, use the following command to navigate to
the `data` folder:

```source
cd /D %userprofile%\Desktop\swc-python\data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

2\. Start Jupyter server

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Unix shell

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Command Prompt (Windows)

```source
python -m notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

3\. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button on the right and selecting "Python 3"
from the drop-down menu:
